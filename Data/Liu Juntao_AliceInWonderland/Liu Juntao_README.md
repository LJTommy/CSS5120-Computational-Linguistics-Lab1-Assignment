## 2. Dataset Introduction

**Content of the dataset**：
This dataset contains the complete text of Lewis Carroll's classic novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". This version is sourced from Project Gutenberg and is in plain text UTF-8 format, ensuring the correct encoding of characters.

**Characteristics of the dataset**：
- **Genre**: 19th-century children's literature and fantasy novels. 
- **Language**: Early modern English, featuring rich dialogues, imaginative narratives and poetry. 
- **Structure**: A continuous narrative text consisting of 12 chapters. 
- **Value**: As a public domain work, it is highly suitable for natural language processing tasks such as text analysis, language model training, style imitation, vocabulary complexity research or narrative structure analysis.

**Data Acquisition Method**:
1. Visit the Project Gutenberg website (https://www.gutenberg.org).
2. Search for book ID `11` or the title "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".
3. Download the file in "Plain Text UTF-8" format.
4. Use a text editor to manually remove the Gutenberg project metadata and copyright notice at the beginning and end of the file, leaving only the main content of the novel, thus purifying the data.

**The planned research purposes**:
In the subsequent course projects, I intend to utilize this dataset for the following explorations:
1. **Text Generation**: As a corpus for fine-tuning small language models, I aim to generate texts with a fantasy and humorous style.
2. **Narrative Analysis**: Analyze transitions between chapters, patterns of character dialogues, or emotional curves.
3. **Comparison with Other Datasets**: For instance, conduct comparative analyses in terms of word frequency, syntactic complexity, etc., between 19th-century English literature and modern social media texts.
